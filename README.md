# IEEEHackathon

Attended IEEE Manipal's Hackathon in 2019, had an overnight stay in the library;

Worked on a basic NN for face detection, and created a basic html webpage(without knowing any web dev skills xD) and created an app as well.
Failed in making the whole product, somehow managed to showcase our idea showing master and slave in laptop as well as app.
