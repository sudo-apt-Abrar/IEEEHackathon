# IEEEHackathon

Attended IEEE Manipal's Hackathon in 2019, had an overnight stay in the library;

Worked on a basic NN for face detection, and created a basic html webpage(without knowing any web dev skills xD) and created a basic app as well.
Failed in making the whole product, somehow managed to showcase our idea showing a basic master and slave in laptop as well as app.
